Pneumonia Prediction using X-RAY images
  Smart Internz guided project.The main objective of this project is to help the doctors to predict the pneumonia disease more accurately using a deep learning model. The objective is not only to help the doctors but also to the patients to verify whether they have pneumonia or not. By using this model we can precisely predict pneumonia. A convolutional neural network model is built from scratch to extract features from a given chest X-ray image and classify it to determine if a person is infected with pneumonia. a web is built where the user can upload the x - ray image and the result is shown on the UI
